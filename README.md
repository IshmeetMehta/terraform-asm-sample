# Build GKE cluster and deploy Anthos Service Mesh on the cluster.

# Pre-requistes 

1. Install Google Cloud SDK
2. Install Terraform
3. Active Anthos trial license

## Steps to deploy the terraform

1. Clone this repo
1. Set variables that will be used in multiple commands:

    ```bash
    FOLDER_ID = [FOLDER]
    BILLING_ACCOUNT = [BILLING_ACCOUNT]
    PROJECT_ID = [PROJECT_ID]
    ```

1. Create project:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID --name=$PROJECT_ID --folder=$FOLDER_ID
    gcloud alpha billing projects link $PROJECT_ID --billing-account $BILLING_ACCOUNT
    gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

1. Create cluster using terraform using defaults other than the project:

    ```bash
    # obtain user access credentials to use for Terraform commands
    gcloud auth application-default login

    # continue in /terraform directory
    cd terraform
    export TF_VAR_project_id=$PROJECT_ID
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```
   NOTE: if you get an error due to default network not being present, run `gcloud compute networks create default --subnet-mode=auto` and retry the commands.

1. To verify things have sync'ed, you can use `gcloud` to check status:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships list --project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

1. To review the state the of asm installation, lets inspect the cluster:

    ```bash
    # get values from cluster that was created


    # First lets get the credentials for the GKE cluster 
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials asm-cluster-1 --region "us-central1" --project $PROJECT_ID


    # Inspect the state of controlplanerevision CustomResource
    kubectl describe controlplanerevision asm-managed -n istio-system
    
    The output is similar to the following:

    # Review the status of the controlplanerevision custom resource named asm-managed, the RECONCILED field should be set to True.
    kubectl get controlplanerevisions -n istio-system

    The output is similar to the following:


            NAME          RECONCILED   STALLED   AGE
            asm-managed   True         False     14m

    # Review the configmaps in the istio-system namespace.

    kubectl get configmaps -n istio-system

    The output is similar to the following:


        NAME                   DATA   AGE
        asm-options            1      20m

        mdp-eviction-leader    0      12m



    ```

1. Finally, let's clean up. Apply `terraform destroy` to remove the GCP resources that were deployed to the project.

   ```bash
    Disable the service mesh feature:

    gcloud container hub mesh disable --project $PROJECT_ID

    terraform destroy -var=project_id=$PROJECT_ID
    ```
